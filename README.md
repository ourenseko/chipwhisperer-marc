==================

This is my version of ChipWhisperer.

You're looking at the second drop of several, based on original
ChipWhisperer git from Aug-2016.


Features and documentation
--------------------------

Tutorials:

  - [Install on Linux Mint 18](doc/marc/install_mint18/install_mint18.md)

Preprocessing filters:

  - Cache: RAM
  - Resync: Slice-to-Slot

Chiper: [Keeloq for ChipWhisperer](doc/marc/keeloq/keeloq.md)

  - Partition modes
  - Attack scripts
  - Tutorials
  - Example traces

Other small improvements:

  - UI changes
  - Accessible color palette
  - Plugin/script API extensions
  - Performance improvements and bug fixes

For features already present in the original ChipWhisperer, see:

  - [https://wiki.newae.com](https://wiki.newae.com/)
  - [https://newae.com/sidechannel/cwdocs/](https://newae.com/sidechannel/cwdocs/)


Still to come...
----------------

Please be patient and give me some time for cleaning up the
rest of my code:

  - Keeloq Hamming distance attack
  - rebase to latest upstream git

Also:

  - Slice-to-Slot filter documentation


Information about this fork
---------------------------

My intention is to stay near the original code base, and applying all
changes in the least invasive way possible.

I have no write permission to the original repository and can't
contribute directly.  Using the fork I am sharing my work with
the public and also with the ChipWhisperer team.  Hopefully they
will pull them into the main codebase.

Thanks
------

Thanks to *Colin O'Flynn* for making ChipWhisperer open-source.
This extension would not exist otherwise.  Also, because of it, I
learned python, git, and markdown.  Thanks for that!
